A Chicagoan by birth, Miller obtained his bachelor degree in history from Northwestern University, his master's in history from Columbia University, and his PhD in history from Rutgers University where he wrote his dissertation about Byzantine diplomacy between the 6th and 10th century. After serving as an assistant professor at Saint Peter's College, Miller was appointed an associate professor at University of Rochester in 1963.Miller taught at the University of Rochester for three decades—his entire academic career—from 1963 to 1993. He specialized in the classics, Celtic studies and Indo-European studies, with a particular focus on Heroic poetry. <br><br> Within seven years at Rochester he was appointed a full professor of history there, and also held a secondary appointment in religion and classics. Miller researched a diverse set of subjects, including the Byzantine Empire, Ancient Sparta, Greek mythology and Indo-European studies. He was proficient in a large number of languages, including Latin, Ancient Greek, French, German, and Russian, Old Church Slavonic and Bulgarian. Miller was an adherent of Georges Dumézil's research on Indo-European religion, and published several papers on the relevance of Dumézil's work.  <br><br> Miller retired from the University of Rochester in 1993, but continued research, write and attend academic conferences. He was a mythology editor for the Journal of Indo-European Studies. His magnum opus, The Epic Hero, was published in 2000. It was the result of 20 years of scholarship, drew on interdiciplinary research spanning the fields of classics, anthropology, psychology, philology, and spanned all the Western epic traditions, including Greek, Roman, Nordic and Celtic, in addition to Indian and Persian. The Epic Hero was selected as an Outstanding Academic Title by Choice. </p>

            <h2>Works</h2>
            <p>An unapologetic admirer of Georges Dumézil, a French comparative philologist best known for his analysis of sovereignty and power in Proto-Indo-European religion and society, Miller published several papers on the philologist's work and relevance.</p>

                <quote> “Being a Dumézilian involves a lot of difficult languages, a lot of myth and ritual, a lot of structural thinking and imagination—so it's got it all if you are a humanist,” says Miller's friend Douglas Brooks, a professor of religion, who first met Miller some 33 years ago when Brooks himself had just arrived on campus.</quote> <br>
